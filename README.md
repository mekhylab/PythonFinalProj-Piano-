Piano Dash: Rhythm Game
In just a sentence or two, summarize your project.

A Pygame rhythm game inspired by Piano Tiles, where players must press the correct piano keys as falling notes reach the bottom of the screen. The goal is to score points by hitting notes accurately and keeping up with the rhythm. Ideally we will have three levels if we plan accordingly.
In a paragraph or more, detail your project.
Our software will be a rhythm game built in Python using Pygame called Piano Dash. Notes fall from the top of the screen in time with a beat, and players must press the matching key when a tile reaches the hit line. Correct hits raise the score and play a piano sound, while misses reduce it. The game will feature multiple levels with increasing speed, background music, and color effects. It will run in Pygame through VS Code.

If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

This project is for CIS 1051 only and is not combined with another course.

In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.
In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?
Notes fall down the screen and the player can press keys to hit them when they reach the bottom.


The game keeps track of score and ends when the player misses too many notes.


In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?
Everything from “GOOD,” plus real piano note sounds for each key, smoother falling animations, and multiple speed levels or difficulty modes.


In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?
Everything from “BETTER,” plus background music, colorful visual effects, a start/restart menu, and maybe a “song mode” where notes fall in rhythm to a short melody.


In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?
Our next steps are to learn how to animate falling tiles in Pygame and detect when they reach the hit line. We will practice using pygame.mixerr to load and play piano sounds and manage timing so notes fall at the right intervals. We will also work on detecting when the player hits the correct key, showing score updates, and adding simple menus. We plan to divide tasks by milestones such as getting tiles to fall, adding input detection, sound, scoring, visuals, and levels.
